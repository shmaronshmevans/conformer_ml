""" DropBlock, DropPath

PyTorch implementations of DropBlock and DropPath (Stochastic Depth) regularization layers.

Papers:
DropBlock: A regularization method for convolutional networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12890)

Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth (https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382)

Code:
DropBlock impl inspired by two Tensorflow impl that I liked:
 - https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/models/official/resnet/resnet_model.py#L74
 - https://github.com/clovaai/assembled-cnn/blob/master/nets/blocks.py
